<h1>SEInception-ResNet: Fall Detection Using Deep Learning</h1>

This project involves developing a deep learning model for fall detection using a specialized architecture called SEInception-ResNet. The code preprocesses a dataset containing fall detection images and corresponding labels and builds a classification model using advanced neural network architectures.
