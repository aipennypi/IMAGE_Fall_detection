<h1>SEInception-ResNet: Fall Detection Using Deep Learning</h1>

This project involves developing a deep learning model for fall detection using a specialized architecture called SEInception-ResNet. The code preprocesses a dataset containing fall detection images and corresponding labels and builds a classification model using advanced neural network architectures.

<h2>Workflow</h2>

Dataset Preparation:

Organize images and labels in the respective directories (images/train and labels/train).

Ensure proper bounding box annotations in the label files.

Data Preprocessing:

Load and preprocess the dataset using the provided data preprocessing functions.

Resize images and normalize pixel values.

Model Definition:

Choose between SEInception-ResNet v1 or v2 based on your requirements.

Adjust model parameters like input dimensions, number of classes, and dropout rate.

Model Training:

Compile the model with appropriate optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

Use TensorFlow's Model.fit API to train the model on the preprocessed dataset.

Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on a separate test dataset to assess performance.

Deployment:

Export the trained model for deployment in real-time fall detection applications.
